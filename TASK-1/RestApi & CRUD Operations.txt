Task 1: What is "REST API" and CRUD operations.

Representational State Transfer API which is used to build the web services and allows for the communication between client and the server over the https.
The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) have various methods such as:
1. GET (use to retrieve the resource/data)
2. POST (use to create a new resource each time)
3. PUT (Update the entire resource)
4. Delete (Delete/remove the resources)

The key characteristics of Rest API are that it stores the necessary information from client and server does not store the client session data.
other than that using it is using https methods to perform any action on resources.
it supports multiple data formats such as XML and JSON.

CRUD Operations includes 4 Operations which are Create,Read,Update,Delete .
Their Purposes are as Following:
1. Create is use to create a new resource.
2. Read is use to retrieve one or more resource
3. Update is use to make changes/modification in an existing resources
4. Delete is use for deleting any resources.

With the help of HTTPS methods CRUD uses Create with POST , Read with GET , Update with Put/Patch (patch can be used for partial updation in resources)
- A REST API follows various REST principles and allows communication over HTTP.
- CRUD operations are used to manage resources in REST APIs.
- HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) correspond to CRUD actions.
